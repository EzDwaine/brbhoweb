        <p class="history__p">
          Binangonan Rural Bank, Inc. (BRB) was established in October 4, 1961 by Atty. Teofilo Tanjuatco, a lawyer
          and banker from Quezon City. Atty. Tanjuatco was the first President and Chairman of the Bank.<br>

          BRB obtained its authority to operate from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on November 13, 1961,
          making BRB the oldest bank in Binangonan, Rizal. The Bank is registered with BSP as a Rural Bank under
          Republic Act No. 7353, Section 6 and 12. In January 4, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
          approved the extension of BRB's corporate life for another 50 years.<br><br>

          In February 2012, Quezon Capital Rural Bank (QCRB), one the best performing Rural Banks in the Philippines
          with over 40 branches, acquired majority control of the Bank, together with the families of Mayor Herbert
          Bautista and Renato Mercado. In May 2013, the SEC approved an increase in BRB's authorized capital to P25.0M
          from P11.0M previously. BRB's Board of Directors has again approved the increase in authorized capital to
          P100.0M.<br><br>

          A group of Filipino and Australian investors lead by Mr. Robert Guy Tesoriero and Mr. Gregory Stephen Adams
          and their Filipino partner, Ms. Leah Felisa T. Faustino, acquired majority ownership of BRB in 2016. This
          new group's vision is to transform BRB into a "Digital Bank" with digital product offering utilizing
          financial technologies designed to support an inclusive financial system by initially delivering cash cards
          to the lower-income, unbanked and underserved segments of the country, especially in the rural areas. BRB
          has branded its digital operations under "BRB Digital", to differentiate it from its traditional banking
          operations.<br><br>

          BRB applied and was granted an Electronic Money Issuer (EMI) License by the BSP in July 2017.<br><br>

            BRB Digital is the first Philippine Rural Bank to launch its E-Money operations.<br><br>

            BRB Digital has its own complete E-money system and facilities, including Card Management and Remittance
            System, Card Issuing and Personalization System, Switch, among others.<br><br>

            As part of BRB's E-Money product offerings, it has initially launch its Cash Card products available to its
            BRB customers and the general public as Cashmate Card. It is also available as co-branded card for payroll,
            loan release, pension, etc.<br><br>

            BRB will launch its E-Wallet, online banking, mobile banking facilities by Q2 2019.<br><br>

            From being the oldest bank in Binangonan, Rizal, whose original mission was to extend credit to small
            farmers and merchants, BRB has now evolved into the most progressive and innovative Digital Rural Bank not
            only in Rizal but in the whole Philippines.<br><br>
